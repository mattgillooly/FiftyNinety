# NiftyFinety

[NiftyFinety](https://niftyfinety.com/) is a suite of utilities for enhancing your 50/90 experience.

[50/90](http://fiftyninety.fawmers.org/) is a summer-long songwriting challenge.

> This is the marathon of songwriting known as the 50 Songs in 90 Days Challenge. Between July 4th and October 1st, participants attempt to write fifty songs. Songwriters will test their creative mettle by trying to create a finished song in less than 2 days every day for nearly 3 months.

I am not affiliated with the creators and/or organizers of 50/90, but I am a participant, and these utilities have come from my own wishlist.
I hope they help you too!
